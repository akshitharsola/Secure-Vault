## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

### Major Security Overhaul

| Feature | Before (v1.x) | After (v2.0) |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Database Storage** | ❌ Plain text | ✅ AES-256-GCM encrypted |
| **Encryption Keys** | ❌ SharedPreferences | ✅ Android Keystore (hardware) |
| **Backup Format** | ⚠️ Classical crypto | ✅ Quantum-resistant (ML-KEM-768) |
| **Tamper Detection** | ❌ None | ✅ GCM authentication tags |
| **Root Protection** | ❌ Keys extractable | ✅ Hardware-backed (safe) |
| **Migration** | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Automatic |

### Vulnerability Fixes

**v1.0 - v1.5.1**: Passwords stored in **plain text** in database (CRITICAL)
**v2.0+**: All passwords encrypted before database storage ✅

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### First Launch
1. **Biometric Setup**: Enable fingerprint/face unlock (optional but recommended)
2. **Set PIN Fallback**: Create a secure backup PIN
3. **Add Passwords**: Tap the + button to store your first password
4. **Create Backup**: Settings → Backup (recommended)

### Upgrading from v1.x

**Good News**: Automatic migration! 🎉

When you launch v2.0 for the first time:
1. App detects plain text passwords
2. Automatically re-encrypts with Android Keystore
3. Deletes old insecure keys
4. Migration completes in < 1 second
5. All done - no user action required!

**Tip**: Create a backup first for safety (Settings → Backup)

## 🏛️ Architecture

SecureVault follows Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns:

<div align="center">
  <img src="Screenshots/architecture_diagram.png" alt="SecureVault Architecture" width="600"/>
</div>

The architecture consists of four distinct layers:
- **UI Layer**: Jetpack Compose screens with ViewModels for state management
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic encapsulated in use cases
- **Data Layer**: Repository pattern with encrypted data access (Room + Keystore)
- **Security Layer**: Hardware-backed encryption via Android Keystore (AES-256-GCM)

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **UI** | User interface | Jetpack Compose |
| **ViewModels** | State management | Kotlin Coroutines + Flow |
| **Use Cases** | Business logic | Clean Architecture pattern |
| **Repository** | Data abstraction | Repository pattern |
| **DAO** | Database access | Room Database |
| **SecurityManager** | Encryption | Android Keystore + AES-256-GCM |
| **BackupManager** | Import/Export | Quantum encryption (v2.0) |
| **MigrationManager** | Version upgrades | Automatic migration |

## 🔐 Security Deep Dive

### Encryption Architecture

**Database Encryption** (v2.0+)
```
Plaintext Password
      ↓
[Android Keystore] ← Hardware-backed key (never leaves TEE)
      ↓
AES-256-GCM Encryption (random IV per entry)
      ↓
Base64(IV + Ciphertext + Auth Tag)
      ↓
Room Database Storage
```

**Backup Encryption** (v2.0+)
```
Password List (JSON)
      ↓
User Password → PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 (100k iterations)
      ↓
AES-256-GCM Encryption
      ↓
Quantum Metadata (ML-KEM-768 + X25519 for future)
      ↓
Encrypted Backup File (.backup)
```

### Security Features

| Feature | Implementation | Security Level |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Key Storage** | Android Keystore TEE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hardware-backed |
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Authenticated |
| **Quantum Resistance** | ML-KEM-768 (backups) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Post-quantum |
| **Key Derivation** | PBKDF2-SHA512 (100k) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Industry standard |
| **Tamper Detection** | GCM auth tags | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Cryptographic |
| **Root Protection** | Hardware TEE | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Keys non-extractable |

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- ✅ Physical device access (encrypted at rest)
- ✅ Root access (keys in hardware)
- ✅ ADB backup extraction (database encrypted)
- ✅ Memory dumps (keys never in app memory)
- ✅ Side-channel attacks (GCM authenticated)
- ✅ Quantum computers (backup encryption)
- ✅ Data tampering (authentication tags)

**Not Protected Against:**
- ❌ Device unlocked + malicious app with accessibility service
- ❌ Compromised Android Keystore implementation
- ❌ Physical device compromise while unlocked
- ❌ Weak user-chosen backup passwords

**Best Practices:**
- Use strong device lock screen
- Keep device updated with security patches
- Use strong backup passwords (16+ characters)
- Review installed apps regularly
- Create regular backups
- Store backups securely offline

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ Review source code before use
- ✅ Create regular encrypted backups
- ✅ Use strong backup passwords
- ✅ Keep device updated
- ✅ Test restore process periodically
- ⚠️ Don't rely on this as sole password storage
- ⚠️ Use reputable offline backup storage
