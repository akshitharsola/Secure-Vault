ADDITIONAL SECURITY DISCLAIMER:

This software is a password manager application designed to store sensitive
information. While the developers have implemented security best practices
including:

- Hardware-backed AES-256-GCM encryption via Android Keystore
- Quantum-resistant backup encryption (ML-KEM-768 + X25519)
- Biometric authentication with PIN fallback
- Automatic migration from plain text to encrypted storage
- Transaction-safe backup restore with rollback capability
- GCM authentication tags for tamper detection

Users should understand:

1. Review the source code and security implementation before use
2. No software is 100% secure against all threats
3. Maintain regular encrypted backups of their data
4. Use strong, unique passwords/PINs for backup encryption
5. Keep devices updated with latest security patches
6. Report any security vulnerabilities responsibly to:
   https://github.com/akshitharsola/Secure-Vault/security
7. This is open-source software provided as-is

The developers make no warranties regarding the security of data stored
within this application and shall not be liable for any data loss,
unauthorized access, or security breaches that may occur. Users assume
all risks associated with storing sensitive information in this application.

RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE:

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
- Do NOT open a public GitHub issue
- Report privately via GitHub Security Advisories
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- We appreciate responsible security researchers

QUANTUM SECURITY NOTE:

While v2.0+ implements quantum-resistant encryption for backups using
NIST-standardized algorithms (ML-KEM-768), users should be aware that:
- Database encryption uses classical AES-256-GCM (secure for now)
- Quantum computers capable of breaking AES-256 do not yet exist
- Future updates may add quantum-resistant database encryption
- Regular backups using v2.0 format provide quantum-resistant archival
