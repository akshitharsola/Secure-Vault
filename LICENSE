ADDITIONAL SECURITY DISCLAIMER:

This software is a password manager application designed to store sensitive
information. While the developers have implemented security best practices
including:

- Hardware-backed AES-256-GCM encryption via Android Keystore
- Quantum-resistant backup encryption (ML-KEM-768 + X25519)
- Biometric authentication with PIN fallback
- Automatic migration from plain text to encrypted storage
- Transaction-safe backup restore with rollback capability
- GCM authentication tags for tamper detection

Users should understand:

1. Review the source code and security implementation before use
2. No software is 100% secure against all threats
3. Maintain regular encrypted backups of their data
4. Use strong, unique passwords/PINs for backup encryption
5. Keep devices updated with latest security patches
6. Report any security vulnerabilities responsibly to:
   https://github.com/akshitharsola/Secure-Vault/security
7. This is open-source software provided as-is

The developers make no warranties regarding the security of data stored
within this application and shall not be liable for any data loss,
unauthorized access, or security breaches that may occur. Users assume
all risks associated with storing sensitive information in this application.

RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE:

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
- Do NOT open a public GitHub issue
- Report privately via GitHub Security Advisories
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- We appreciate responsible security researchers

QUANTUM SECURITY NOTE:

While v2.0+ implements quantum-resistant encryption for backups using
NIST-standardized algorithms (ML-KEM-768), users should be aware that:
- Database encryption uses classical AES-256-GCM (secure for now)
- Quantum computers capable of breaking AES-256 do not yet exist
- Future updates may add quantum-resistant database encryption
- Regular backups using v2.0 format provide quantum-resistant archival

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES (v2.1+):

This application integrates Google AdMob for advertising purposes to sustain
ongoing development and maintenance. By using this application, you acknowledge
and agree to the following:

Google AdMob Integration:
- Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Terms of Service: https://policies.google.com/terms
- Ad Personalization Control: Android Settings → Privacy → Ads
- AdChoices: https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/

Data Collection by AdMob:
- Device advertising ID (resettable in Android Settings)
- Basic device information (model, OS version, screen size)
- App usage analytics (app opens, ad impressions - anonymous)
- Network connection for ad loading

Data NOT Shared with AdMob:
- Password data (remains encrypted locally with hardware-backed keys)
- Usernames, account details, or any encrypted information
- Backup files or encryption keys
- Biometric data or authentication information
- Any personal identifiable information (PII)

Privacy Guarantees:
- Password encryption occurs BEFORE ad SDK initialization
- Ads are rendered in isolated UI components
- No shared memory between password storage and ad SDK
- All password data transmission is ZERO - completely offline storage
- Network traffic verified to only contact AdMob endpoints

Architectural Separation:
- SecurityManager (password encryption) operates independently
- AdManager (ad loading) has NO access to password database
- Separate coroutine scopes and StateFlows
- UI components are isolated (PasswordItem vs NativeAdCard)

User Rights:
- You can opt out of personalized ads in Android Settings
- You can reset your advertising ID at any time
- You can inspect network traffic to verify no password data transmission
- Source code is available for security audit on GitHub

If you have privacy concerns, you may:
1. Review the open-source code on GitHub
2. Build from source and verify network behavior
3. Use network monitoring tools (Charles Proxy, Wireshark)
4. Report any suspicious activity via GitHub Issues

The developers are committed to transparency and will never transmit password
data to any third-party service. Ad integration is strictly for revenue to
support continued development while maintaining the app's core security promise.

Future versions may include an ad-free premium option.
